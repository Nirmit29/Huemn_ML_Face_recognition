# Huemn_ML_Face_recognition
Face recognition uses machine learning to identify or verify individuals based on their facial features.

This project provides a face detection and recognition system using OpenCV and the face_recognition library. It enables you to detect faces in images and match them against known faces.

Features
Face Detection: Identify faces within an image.
Face Recognition: Match detected faces to known individuals based on facial features.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository: Download the project files using Git.
Create a Virtual Environment: Set up an isolated Python environment (optional but recommended).
Install Required Packages: Use the provided requirements.txt to install necessary dependencies.
Usage
Face Detection: The system detects faces in images and returns their locations.
Face Recognition: It compares detected faces against a list of known face encodings to identify or verify individuals.
Performance
Accuracy: Measures how well the system correctly identifies known faces.
Speed: Assesses the time taken to process and recognize faces in images.
Optimization
Inference Time: Techniques are applied to enhance processing speed.
Scalability: Methods for efficient handling of large datasets are used.

My basic understanding Analysis - 

For example 

Take Input 
An image file with detected faces (e.g., test_image.jpg).
A list of known face encodings and their corresponding names (e.g., known_faces_encodings, known_face_names).

Gives Output 
A list of tuples where each tuple contains:
The bounding box of the face detected.
The name of the person recognized, or "Unknown" if the face is not recognized.
Example output: [((30, 50, 100, 150), 'Nirmit'), ((200, 80, 120, 180), 'Mohit')]
